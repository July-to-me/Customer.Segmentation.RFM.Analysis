# Customer.Segmentation.RFM.Analysis
SQL Project that helped me understand more about the logic of SQL, as well as an introductory to the data visualization platform called Tableau.

## Objective

In this project, I wanted to learn more about how to do SQL. Here is a rundown of what I've done:
1. Getting the data (I am not sure where I've found it but I have reasons to believe it is from Kaggle)
3. Compliling various queries that showcase what are we looking at. Along with creating tables to save on Tableau to do data analysis.
4. Load the new RFM data into Tableau in order to do some nice data visuals. 

## Dataset

As mentioned before, I have no idea where I've gotten my data but I think I got it from Kaggle.

(I will send the link to the dataset once I've found the origins from it)


## Discovery

Here is a small conclusion that I've found based on my findings:
- The item that created the most amount of revenue from our customers is classic cards, with vintage cars being a close second
- Our e-commerce line is thriving as over 90% of our sales are shipped to the customer
- We have less than 2% of orders being canceled, along with orders on hold being less than a 1%. 
- We have the most amount of monthly sales during the seasonal times (back to school, Thanksgiving, and summer)
- Euro Shopping Channel contains the most amount of customers overall
- Mini Gifts Distributors Ltd. contains the most amount of customers in the United States (but is second when compared overall)
